# Solution Overview

Using regular expressions, we can easily match the proposed conditions:
- you
- youuu
- u


The regex that matches those conditions is `r"\b(you+|u+)\b"`.
- The `\b` is a boundary anchor.It is used to make sure the match (you, u) doesn't happen inside a word like Bayou.
- The `(you+|u)` matches "you" with one or more "u" at the end (hence the +), OR (hence the | )  "u".

Next, using the `re` lib (regular expressions), we can replace all the matches found with a given regular expression with a string (or a function with conditions, but this is not needed in this use case). I also used the flag `IGNORECASE` to, well, ignore cases during the regular expression match process.
